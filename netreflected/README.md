# Assembly Reflected 

The available reflected classes are generated starting from root assemblies, generation is done using up to 10 recursions to explore for exportable Exceptions.
There are two main folders:
* **Framework** contains the reflected classes generated from .NET Framework, divided by the containing assembly
* **Core** contains the reflected classes generated from .NET Core 3.1, divided by the containing assembly

**JCOReflector** is the folder of common classes for both **Framework** and **Core**

## Framework

## CoreCLR (reference is .NET Core 3.1)
